We have only stabilized a connection to the American Revolution. We can push you to the early, middle or late periods of the era. While there, you will be inhabiting a historical figure and you will have you make an integral decision that they had to make. I warn you though, if you make the wrong decision, well you may create a paradox. I don't think nature likes paradoxes. So, feel free to make your choices. I'm sure everything will go well. You've studied your history, right? I look forward to seeing you again. What am I kidding, I'll never see you again. I won't remember any of this.",

Come down the streets you see in the distance a middle aged black man with a club in his hand shouting, leading a crowd of people forward holding clubs and balls of ice. They look angry and are shouting that they are tired of the British. Maybe taking on the perspective of him might be interesting, of course, it might also be better, to just jump ahead, and get a more bird's eye picture of it all.",

Word is circulating that the soldiers will be going to trial, and your goal is to ensure tha they are held accountable for murdering five boston citizens. Looking at Henry Pelham's first illustration of the event, you decide a woodcut that gets to the heart of the issue and makes it clear who are the victims in the event would be most useful. (1) You begin by making sure that the British soldiers are lined up in a line, with angular faces to illustrate their aggressive stances. You show the colonists as laborers and gentelemen who are shocked and afraid of the violence, as though it was entirely unexpected. You call the Customs Hall the 'Butcher's Hall' to make it clear what the British are doing here, and show a dog murdered in the strength to sympbolize how loyalty is treated. While you lighten Crispus Attucks' skin, you do indicate that there is at least one individual of a slightly off color complexion. And finally, you erase all of the symbols of violence, and you make the weather beautiful. What stands before you is a rallying cry that will stand the test of time, and unify the colonies in anger against the British. (2)",

Bennett \nMeeting Times: Tuesday/Thursday 9:30 AM - 10:45 AM \nLocation: SO 3025\n\nI began this project to create an introductory demo to showcase one methodology in presenting historical narratives using digital tools, and a core component part of that  challenge was rooted in completing the project in approximately twenty-four hours. I succeeded, with a finished project in 24 hours. The prototype is of course only a simple 'choose-your-own-adventure,' but the baseline structure could be modified to include features like dead ends and point systems that could further gamify interactions and boost engagement. My point is, this is just the beginning. Digital narratives offer historians an amazing diversity in opportunities in shaping new narratives. That is the primary aim of this class, to introduce scholars like you to the new opportunities that digital media provides within the historical profession. I look forward to seeing you in class next semester. \n\nOffice Hours: SO 4083",
